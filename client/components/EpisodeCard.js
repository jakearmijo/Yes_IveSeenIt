              The pilot episode of what would later become NBC's immensely
              popular sitcom Seinfeld might now appear to most viewers as a
              "bizarro" version of the show they came to know and love. For
              starters, the show was actually called The Seinfeld Chronicles and
              is completely void of Julia Louis-Dreyfuss' character, Elaine
              Benes. On top of that, instead of Kramer, Michael Richards'
              character is known as Kessler (TV Guide listed the character as
              Hoffman for some reason). Despite these few unsettling
              differences, the episode still follows a trademark plot about
              nothing as Jerry and George discuss the possible reasons why
              Jerry's new girlfriend wants to stay over several nights.
              Originally airing July 5, 1989, "Good News, Bad News" featured
              guest appearances by Lee Garlington and Pamela Brull.
